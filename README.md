The url for the challange: http://vod.stillhackinganyway.nl/

When I checked the source code, I found the following comment:

<!-- *Knock Knock* 88 156 983 1287 8743 5622 9123 -->

After searching google for a while I understood that this probably had something to do with with "Port Knocking" and I found a write-up on another CTF challange related to "Port Knocking": https://f4l13n5n0w.github.io/blog/2015/06/21/vulnhub-knock-knock-1-dot-1/
